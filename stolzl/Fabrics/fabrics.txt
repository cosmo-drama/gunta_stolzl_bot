Gunta Stölzl - excerpt from The Development of the Bauhaus Weaving Workshop, 1931, discussing the Weimar years  the evolution and changes in textiles design.

"Gradually a change took place. We began to sense how pretentious these independent, unique pieces were:  tablecloths, curtains, wall coverings. The richness of colour and form became too licentious for us; it did not adapt itself, it did not subordinate itself to living. We tried to become more simple, to discipline our means, to use these in a more straightforward and functional way. Thus we came to yard goods which could directly serve the room, the living problem. The watchword of the new epoch was models for industry."
